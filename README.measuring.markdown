# How to measure a printed target


## MeasureTool

MeasureTool is a part of the ProfileMaker software package, which may be downloaded from <http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=757&Action=support&SoftwareID=931>.  While the full package requires a paid license to run, parts of MeasureTool will run in "demo" mode, which is enough to measure a target.

  - connect the spectrophotometer (IMPORTANT that this is done first)
  - launch the **MeasureTool** application (in /Applications/ProfileMaker Pro 5.0.10/MeasureTool)
  - click *Tools* menu and select *Test Chart Measurement...*
  - click *Open...* button
  - select target description file (*.txt)
  - click *Start* button
  - calibrate spectrophotometer as instructed
  - click *Mode* popup and select *Strip without gaps*
  - measure strips in turn
  - click *Close* button
  - click *Export Lab...* button
  - save as target measurement file (*.txt)
  - (no need to save any further measurement file)
  
## ColorPort

ColorPort may be downloaded from <http://www.xrite.com/product_overview.aspx?ID=719&Action=support&SoftwareID=1032>.

NOTE: Unfortunately, ColorPort doesn't seem to be able to import our target reference descriptions, perhaps due to subtle format differences.  For now, use MeasureTool.
